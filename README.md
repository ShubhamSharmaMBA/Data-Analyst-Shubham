**Data Analytics Projects on AWS Cloud**

This repository highlights my experience designing and implementing AWS Cloud data analytics platforms. The projects include:

**UCW Registrar Team** – Automating and optimizing student enrollment and withdrawal workflows.

**City of Vancouver** – Building a robust data analytics platform for managing and analyzing city property tax data.

Each project is categorized into specific analysis phases: Exploratory Data Analysis, Descriptive Analysis, Diagnostic Analysis, Data Wrangling, and Data Quality Control, with supporting visuals and workflows.

**Project 1: UCW Registrar Team**

This project focused on automating data workflows related to student enrollments and withdrawals, improving the efficiency of managing student data for the Registrar’s Office.

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted an in-depth exploration of student enrollment and withdrawal records to identify trends and patterns in academic terms.
   - Utilized **AWS Glue** to organize and catalog data from various sources, including real-time data on student admissions and withdrawals.
   - Used **AWS Athena** to perform initial data profiling, identifying enrollment period peaks and withdrawal reasons trends.
   - **Amazon S3** was used as the primary storage for the datasets related to student enrollments and withdrawals.
